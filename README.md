# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure



## Overview

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.

In this project, first we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided [Scikit-learn Logistic Regression model](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html). 
The hyperparameters of this model are optimized using HyperDrive. After that, a second model is built and optimized using Azure Auto ML on the on the same dataset.

Then, the results obtained by both models are compared.

A diagram illustrating the steps of this project is shown below:

## Summary

### Dataset and Problem Statement

The dataset used in this project contains data collected during direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. 
This is a subset of the original public dataset available at [UCI Machine Learning repository]( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing). 
In this website a detailed description of each feature can be found.

It consists of 32950 entries, 20 features containing information about `client`, information relative to the `marketing campaign`, and `social and economic` metrics. 

This is a classification problem wich goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) to a bank term deposit (variable `y`).

**original source of the data**:

### Solution and Result

For this classification problem to approaches were used:

1. Apply a Scikit-learn Logistic Regression model, optimizing its hyperparameters using HyperDrive.
2. Use Azure Auto ML to build and optimize a model on the same dataset

As a result, the best model, considering `accuracy` as primary metric was the one obtained using AutoML. It was a Voting Ensemble model. 
However, the accuracy obtained both applying Logistic Regression with HyperDrive and AutoML were close, respectively, 0.9109 and 0.9174.
The main advantage of the AutoML is explainability, so we choose further which features have more weight on the predictions. In addition, 
we can observe the value of other metrics that in the case of an imbalanced dataset as this one can say more than accuracy.
