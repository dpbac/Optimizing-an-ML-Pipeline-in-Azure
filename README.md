# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure



## Overview

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.

In this project, first we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn Logistic Regression model. 
The hyperparameters of this model are optimized using HyperDrive. After that, a second model is built and optimized using Azure Auto ML on the on the same dataset.

Then, the results obtained by both models are compared.

A diagram illustrating the steps of this project is shown below:

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
